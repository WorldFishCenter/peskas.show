      "body": "# Privacy Policy — Taseguru\n\n**Effective date:** 28 February 2026\\\n**Last updated:** 28 February 2026\n\nTaseguru (“the App”) is developed and operated by WorldFish (“we,” “us,” or “our”).\n\nThis Privacy Policy explains how information is collected, used, and protected when you use the Taseguru mobile application.\n\nTaseguru is designed to be used anonymously. We do not collect personal information such as names, phone numbers, national ID numbers, or email addresses.\n\n***\n\n## 1. Information we collect\n\n### 1.1 Municipality-level location data\n\nTo provide relevant marine weather forecasts and alerts, the App collects location data at the scale of municipality only.\n\n* We do not collect precise GPS coordinates by default.\n* We do not track your real-time movements.\n* Location is used only to deliver locally relevant weather information and fisheries updates.\n* You can manage location permissions in your device settings.\n\n### 1.2 Registration support information\n\nDuring initial setup or registration, we may collect limited information about whether you received assistance installing or learning to use the App (for example, from a fisheries officer, NGO staff member, or community facilitator).\n\n* This information is not linked to your identity.\n* It is used only to understand how the App is being introduced and supported.\n* It helps improve outreach and training efforts.\n\n### 1.3 Anonymous usage data (telemetry)\n\nWe collect anonymous usage information through telemetry tools to understand how the App is being used. This may include:\n\n* pages or features viewed;\n* buttons clicked;\n* videos played;\n* frequency and duration of App use; and\n* App performance data (e.g., crashes).\n\nTelemetry data:\n\n* does not include personal identifiers;\n* is aggregated for analysis; and\n* is used only to improve App functionality, usability, and safety impact.\n\n***\n\n## 2. How we use information\n\nWe use the information collected through the App to:\n\n* deliver municipality-specific weather forecasts and fisheries alerts;\n* improve functionality and user experience;\n* understand how safety resources and features are used;\n* improve training and support strategies; and\n* monitor and enhance system performance.\n\nWe do not use data for advertising purposes. We do not sell user data.\n\n***\n\n## 3. How information is shared\n\nBecause Taseguru is anonymous:\n\n* we do not share personal data with third parties; and\n* we may share aggregated, anonymized usage statistics with government partners, donors, or research institutions to evaluate App performance and safety impact.\n\nData may be stored securely using trusted cloud service providers under strict data protection standards. No personally identifiable information is shared.\n\n***\n\n## 4. Data storage and security\n\nWe apply appropriate technical and organizational safeguards to protect collected data.\n\n* Data is stored securely on protected servers.\n* Only authorized personnel may access system-level analytics.\n* Telemetry data is stored in aggregated, non-identifiable form.\n* Data is retained only as long as necessary for operational and analytical purposes.\n\n***\n\n## 5. Your choices\n\nYou may:\n\n* control location permissions in your device settings;\n* stop using the App at any time; and\n* request further information by contacting us (see below).\n\nBecause the App does not collect personal identity information, we are generally unable to identify or retrieve individual user records.\n\n***\n\n## 6. Children’s privacy\n\nTaseguru is intended for adult users involved in fishing or marine activities. We do not knowingly collect or use personal data from children.\n\n***\n\n## 7. Updates to this policy\n\nWe may update this Privacy Policy periodically. Updates will be posted publicly with a revised “Last updated” date. Continued use of the App indicates acceptance of the updated policy.\n\n***\n\n## 8. Contact information\n\nFor questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact:\n\n**WorldFish (ICLARM)**\\\nJalan Batu Maung, Pulau Pinang, Malaysia\\\n[ADH@cgiar.org](mailto:ADH@cgiar.org)\n"
