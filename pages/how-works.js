                                        <h3>1. Discovering fisheries</h3>
                                        <p>At the heart of effective fishery management lies a deep understanding of its starting point. "Discovering Fisheries" is where we initiate our dialogue with the sea. This critical first step in the Peskas approach involves casting our nets wideâ€”not for fish, but for data.</p>
                                        <h4>Comprehend to Conserve</h4>
                                        <p><strong>Intuitive Data Collection:</strong> Leveraging user-friendly digital tools, we meticulously chart the vital signs of marine life. Our tools are designed for precision and ease, enabling fishers and researchers to record data that reflects the true state of our fisheries.</p>
                                        <p><strong>Strategic Engagement:</strong> By aligning with the goals and needs of local stakeholders, we ensure the data serves a dual purpose: to empower local economies and to pave the way for conservation.</p>
                                        <p><strong>Drafting the Blueprint:</strong> This phase is not just about data collection; it's about crafting a narrative that guides the Peskas platform's development to accommodate the unique dynamics of each fishery.</p>
                                        <p>In "Discovering Fisheries," we not only aim to understand the fishery but also to start drafting Peskas around the wealth of knowledge that the seas offer us. It's about shaping a tool that resonates with the rhythm of the waves and the tales of those who navigate them.</p>                                        <p />

                                        <h3>2. Simplifying Data</h3>
                                        <p> In the 'Simplifying Data' phase of Peskas, we tackle the intricate challenge of making complex fisheries data accessible and usable. This step is crucial for transforming collected data into a powerhouse of insights:</p>
                                        <p><strong>Standardization:</strong> We convert diverse data into a common format, aligning with global data standards for seamless integration.</p>
                                        <p><strong>Intuitiveness:</strong> By reorganizing data into more approachable layouts, we enhance user experience, enabling stakeholders to navigate and understand information with ease.</p>
                                        <p><strong>Ontological Alignment:</strong> Our processes ensure that data structures are in sync with established ontologies, which is essential for the interoperability and reliability of data.</p>
                                        <p> The end goal of this phase is not just to simplify data, but to craft a foundation that is both informative and actionable, setting the stage for effective decision-making in fisheries management.</p>
